    "### Continuous Bag-of-Words Model\n",
    "The first proposed architecture is similar to the feedforward NNLM, where the non-linear hidden layer is removed and the projection layer is shared for all words (not just the projection matrix); thus, all words get projected into the same position (their vectors are averaged). \n",
    "\n",
    "We denote this model further as `CBOW`, as unlike standard bag-of-words model, it uses continuous distributed representation of the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Skip-gram Model\n",
    "The second architecture is similar to CBOW, but instead of predicting the current word based on the context, it tries to maximize classification of a word based on another word in the same sentence. More precisely, we use each current word as an input to a log-linear classifier with continuous projection layer, and predict words within a certain range before and after the current word.\n",
