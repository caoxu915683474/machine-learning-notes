## 小结
1. 提到了信息金字塔(Information Pyramid)
1. 提出了通过两个维度来度量文章的质量
    - Rigor (total number of edits for an article) 
    - Diversity (total number of unique users)

## Wikipedia as Open Content
1. Wales and Sanger put the content onto their Web site in the form of a wiki in **January 2001**
1. In the first year it found a loyal following, and generated over 20,000 English language articles and spawned over a dozen language translations
1. After two years, it reached a milestone of 100,000 English articles
1. In February 2004 at the three year mark, it exceeded 200,000 articles in English and 500,000 articles in 50 languages
1. In February 2004, it was adding articles at a rate of roughly 2,000 articles a day across all the various languages

### Keeping it social and neutral
What allows this completely open editing system to function? Because wikis provide the ability to track the status of articles, review individual changes, and discuss issues, they function as **social software**, acting to foster communication and collaboration with other users.

Founder Wales created an editorial policy of maintaining a neutral point of view (`NPOV`) as the guiding principle. “NPOV is an absolute non-negotiable requirement of everything that we do,” he says, and according to Wikipedia’s guidelines, “The neutral point of view attempts to present ideas and facts in such a fashion that both supporters and opponents can agree.” 

### The Knowledge Gap
| Type | Sources | Type | Time Scope
| -- | -- | -- | -- 
| Wisdom | Books, academic journals | Research and analysis | Years, decades, centuries, ad inf.
| Knowledge | Magazines, encyclopedias  | Secondary source | Weeks, months, years
| Information | Newspaper, magazines, TV news, news wire | Primary source | Minutes, hours, days, weeks
| Data | Stock quotes, sports scores, election results, economic statistics, interviews, press conferences | Live feed | Instantaneous, seconds

### Wikipedia Growth
Wikipedia has grown quickly over the last year because it uniquely fills this knowledge gap, **as a constantly updated secondary source.**

## Research
### Methodology
The foundation of this study will be the analysis of Wikipedia articles which were cited in the English-language press from January 2003 to March 2004, including:

- Establishment of a benchmark using representative encyclopedia topics
- Breakdown of publications citing Wikipedia articles
- Analysis of articles cited
- Comparison of metrics against benchmark subjects

For the purposes of the study, two metrics are used as a simple measure for the reputation of the article within the Wikipedia:

- `Rigor` (total number of edits for an article) – The assumption is that more editing cycles on an article provides for a deeper treatment of the subject or more scrutiny of the content.
- `Diversity` (total number of unique users) – With more editors, there are more voices and different points of view for a given subject.

## Results
The first task is to derive the diversity and rigor statistics for each of the 333 benchmark subjects derived from the DK e.encyclopedia after they are mapped onto the equivalent Wikipedia subjects.

Figure 4 Benchmark subjects plotted, showing diversity vs. rigor

In the analysis of these benchmark topics, the median values for rigor and diversity were 61 and 36.5 respectively.

Table 2 Statistics for Benchmark topics (n=333)

| Metric | Max | Min | Average | Median
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 
| Edits (E) | 746 | 4 | 98 | 61
| Unique editors (UE) | 313 | 1 | 51 | 36.5

The median indicates that a hypothetical article with 61 edits and 36.5 unique authors would be in the exact middle of the distribution of benchmark subjects. For Wikipedia, these benchmark are quite high, as the normal average number of edits per article in the entire English Wikipedia is fairly low, at roughly 11.3 edits per article.

If we examine the same data plotted logarithmically in Figure 5, which tries to compensate for the nonlinear distribution by scaling to powers of ten, it is clearer to see where the median value is situated.

### Publications Citing Wikipedia
The following 72 news outlets cited, quoted or referred to Wikipedia in the English language “press” (many were Internet and television sites) from January 2003 to March 2004.

### Visual Comparison and Analysis
**Wikipedia Articles Cited in Press Jan 2003-March 2004 (Before Citation)**

**Wikipedia Articles Cited in Press Jan 2003-March 2004 (After Citation)**

![](http://ou8qjsj0m.bkt.clouddn.com//17-12-5/48165165.jpg)

**Article quality before press citation.** Before being cited, only 15.0% (17 of 113) of these articles were better than the benchmark standard. An article is considered better than the median if, at the time, either its rigor or diversity numbers exceed either of the median values: 36.5 editors or 61 edits.

**Article quality since press citation.** After the citation, the number of articles better than the benchmark standard doubled to 31.0% (35 of 113).

### Top changers
The articles that underwent the most change from before the citation in the press and after the citation are shown in Table 4. (A simple distance formula was used to determine the most change, with equal weighting to the number of unique editors (UE) as x, and the the number of edits (E) as y.

$d=\sqrt{(\delta x)^2+(\delta y)^2}$
